# The Nunalleq Computer Vision Program 
The goal of this project is to design an object recognition algorithm that can be used to automatically detect artifacts housed at the Nunalleq Heritage and Culture Center in Quinhagak, AK. In 2009, concerned citizens contacted archeologists after an ancestral site near Quinhagak began eroding into the Bering Sea.
